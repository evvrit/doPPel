<h1>Doppel</h1>

<h5>No longer in development</h5>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An app made as a marketplace project during my time at Le Wagon coding bootcamp. The user may purchase the services of a "doppelganger" to replace them at an event they do not wish to attend. The user may also sumbit his own roster of doppelgangers for other users to hire.</p>

<h5>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/evvrit">Elyse</a> and <a href="https://github.com/darkanzel">Vinh Tho</a>, my collaborators and teammates on this project</h5>
